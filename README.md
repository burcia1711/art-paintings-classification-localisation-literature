# Computer Vision for Object Classification and Localisation in Art Paintings
## Introduction

Applying computer vision (CV) and machine learning to art paintings enables automatic identification of objects and their locations within artworks. However, models trained on photographs often struggle with paintings â€“ a phenomenon known as the cross-depiction problem [[1]](https://github.com/burcia1711/art-paintings-classification-localisation-literature/blob/main/2016%20-%20Detecting%20People%20in%20Artwork%20with%20CNNs.pdf). Paintings differ from photos in both form (many styles and abstract depictions) and content (symbolic or imaginary objects not seen in everyday life), and large annotated datasets of art are scarce [[2]](https://github.com/burcia1711/art-paintings-classification-localisation-literature/blob/main/2022%20-%20DEArt%20Dataset%20of%20European%20Art.pdf). Despite these challenges, recent research has adapted deep learning methods (e.g. convolutional neural networks and transformers) through transfer learning, domain adaptation, and specialized techniques to detect and localize objects in paintings. This report surveys key academic studies, covering general-purpose approaches and style-specific findings (from Renaissance realism to Cubist abstraction). We highlight important datasets, state-of-the-art methodologies (architectures and transfer strategies), known challenges (stylistic variance, limited labels), and practical applications in art curation, search, and restoration.
